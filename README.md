# Hello! My name is Pedro and this is my Cleverti test.

The instructions can be found at https://github.com/resoptima/frontend-task03.

Tech stack used:

- react
- typescript
- axios
- storybook
- styled-component
- styled-component for TS
- jest
- material-ui
- icons-material

For running the project you will need:

- clone
- install
- start

I tried to show a little bit of everything that I know. <br />
1 example of unit testing - if the endpoint is returning at least 1 movie <br />
3 examples of storybook - text, input and select components <br />
some components are using styled-components, while others are not <br />

Future updates that I can think: <br />
Implement Next.js for SSR, meaning images will render faster. <br />
Because all the images are in the same endpoint, all of them are equals. I would figure some way to make different requests for each movie, that way every movie would get it's own image. <br />

Hope you enjoy it and feel free to contact me about anything! <br />

Thank you :wink:
